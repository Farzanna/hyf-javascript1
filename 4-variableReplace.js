//4. Declare a variable y and assign a string to it.
var y = "a string",
//4.1 Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
console.log(`value of "y" will be: a string`);

//4.2 Now console.log the variable y.
console.log(y);

//4.3 Now assign a new string to the variable y.
console.log(y.replace ("a string","a sentence"));

//4.4 Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
