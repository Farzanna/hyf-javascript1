//6. Arrays
//6.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions)
var items = [];

//6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
console.log(`The items array contains: empty []`);

//6.3 console.log your array.
console.log(items);

//6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
var favoriteAnimals = ["cat", "dog", "parrot"];

//6.5 Log your array.
console.log(favoriteAnimals);

//6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the existing 
favoriteAnimals.push("baby pig");

//6.7 Log your new array!
console.log(favoriteAnimals);
